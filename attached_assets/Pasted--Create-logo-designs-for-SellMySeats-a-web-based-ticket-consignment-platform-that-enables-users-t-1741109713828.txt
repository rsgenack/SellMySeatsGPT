"Create logo designs for 'SellMySeats,' a web-based ticket consignment platform that enables users to upload tickets for resale through a managed service with tracking and payment management, empowering retail sellers and everyday event-goers to sell like powerbrokers. The designs should:

Core Element: Feature a bold, stylized blue 'S' (#4682B4) with perforated edges resembling a ticket stub, symbolizing the brand and ticket resale process. The 'S' should be dynamic, with a sleek curve suggesting movement and confidence.
Accent: Include a small green arrow (#228B22) interacting with the 'S' (e.g., wrapping around, weaving through, or pointing upward) to represent exchange, growth, and empowerment.
Text Integration: Incorporate the full name 'SellMySeats' in a modern, sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Futura, or similar), with 'ellMySeats' flowing seamlessly from the 'S'—either extending from its base, curving alongside it, or integrated into its design for a cohesive look.
Brand Connection: Subtly weave in ticket and seat motifs (e.g., faint ticket lines behind the 'S,' a seat-like curve within its shape, or a ticket stub texture) to reinforce the platform’s purpose without overcrowding the design.
Color Palette: Use blue (#4682B4 or #1E90FF) for trust and reliability, green (#228B22 or #32CD32) for growth and success, and optional white or light gray accents for contrast if needed.
Style: Aim for a clean, professional, and modern aesthetic that’s versatile for branding (e.g., website, marketing materials) while remaining scalable for smaller uses like app icons. Avoid overly complex details to ensure clarity.
Variations: Provide three distinct options:
Option 1: 'S' as a prominent ticket stub with the arrow circling it, 'SellMySeats' below in a bold, straight line.
Option 2: 'S' with the arrow weaving through its center, 'ellMySeats' curving dynamically from the bottom right of the 'S.'
Option 3: 'S' morphing into a subtle seat shape at its base, with 'SellMySeats' arched above or integrated into the design.
The designs should feel energetic, trustworthy, and unique, standing out from competitors like StubHub and Ticketmaster while appealing to both casual sellers and ambitious event-goers."
